              <strong>Mix and Match Components:</strong> Like building with

              something new? Just plug it in without breaking what you&apos;ve
              already built.

              <strong>Runs Anywhere:</strong> Whether it&apos;s a website, app,
              or other platforms, Eva manages conversations across them all.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tailored Chat Behaviors:</strong> Want your AI to speak in
              Shakespeare quotes? Or maybe keep things professional? Eva lets
              you shape conversations exactly how you want them.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Remembers Everything Important:</strong> Using smart
              storage systems, Eva keeps track of conversations in a way that
              helps it give better, more contextual responses - just like a good
              friend would.
